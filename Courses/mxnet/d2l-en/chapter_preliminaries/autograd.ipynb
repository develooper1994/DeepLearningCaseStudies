    "\n",
    "* MXNet provides the `autograd` package to automate the calculation of derivatives. To use it, we first attach gradients to those variables with respect to which we desire partial derivatives. We then record the computation of our target value, execute its `backward` function, and access the resulting gradient via our variable's `grad` attribute.\n",
    "* We can detach gradients to control the part of the computation that will be used in the `backward` function.\n",
    "* The running modes of MXNet include training mode and prediction mode. We can determine the running mode by calling the `is_training` function.\n",

    "1. Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?\n",
    "1. After running `y.backward()`, immediately run it again and see what happens.\n",
    "1. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or matrix. At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?\n",
    "1. Redesign an example of finding the gradient of the control flow. Run and analyze the result.\n",
    "1. Let $f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Plot $f(x)$ and $\\frac{df(x)}{dx}$, where the latter is computed without exploiting that $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$.\n",
    "1. In a second-price auction (such as in eBay or in computational advertising), the winning bidder pays the second-highest price. Compute the gradient of the final price with respect to the winning bidder's bid using `autograd`. What does the result tell you about the mechanism? If you are curious to learn more about second-price auctions, check out the paper by Edelman et al. :cite:`Edelman.Ostrovsky.Schwarz.2007`.\n",
