    "Often, as we process images, we want to gradually\n",
    "reduce the spatial resolution of our hidden representations,\n",
    "aggregating information so that\n",
    "the higher up we go in the network,\n",
    "the larger the receptive field (in the input)\n",
    "to which each hidden node is sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often our ultimate task asks some global question about the image,\n",
    "e.g., *does it contain a cat?*\n",
    "So typically the nodes of our final layer should be sensitive\n",
    "to the entire input.\n",
    "By gradually aggregating information, yielding coarser and coarser maps,\n",
    "we accomplish this goal of ultimately learning a global representation,\n",
    "while keeping all of the advantages of convolutional layers at the intermediate layers of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when detecting lower-level features, such as edges\n",
    "(as discussed in :numref:`sec_conv_layer`),\n",
    "we often want our representations to be somewhat invariant to translation.\n",
    "For instance, if we take the image `X`\n",
    "with a sharp delineation between black and white\n",
    "and shift the whole image by one pixel to the right,\n",
    "i.e., `Z[i, j] = X[i, j+1]`,\n",
    "then the output for the new image `Z` might be vastly different.\n",
    "The edge will have shifted by one pixel and with it all the activations.\n",

    "In fact, even with a tripod and a stationary object,\n",

    "## Maximum Pooling and Average Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Like convolutional layers, pooling operators\n",

    "all regions in the input according to its stride,\n",
    "computing a single output for each location traversed\n",
    "by the fixed-shape window (sometimes known as the *pooling window*).\n",
    "However, unlike the cross-correlation computation\n",
    "of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer,\n",
    "the pooling layer contains no parameters (there is no *filter*).\n",
    "Instead, pooling operators are deterministic,\n",
    "typically calculating either the maximum or the average value\n",
    "of the elements in the pooling window.\n",
    "These operations are called *maximum pooling* (*max pooling* for short)\n",
    "and *average pooling*, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, as with the cross-correlation operator,\n",
    "we can think of the pooling window\n",
    "as starting from the top left of the input array\n",
    "and sliding across the input array from left to right and top to bottom.\n",
    "At each location that the pooling window hits,\n",
    "it computes the maximum or average\n",
    "value of the input subarray in the window\n",
    "(depending on whether *max* or *average* pooling is employed).\n",
