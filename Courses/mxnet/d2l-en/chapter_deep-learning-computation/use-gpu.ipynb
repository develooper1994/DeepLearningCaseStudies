    "Things can get even hairier when\n",
    "we deploy jobs across multiple servers.\n",
    "By assigning arrays to contexts intelligently,\n",
    "we can minimize the time spent\n",
    "transferring data between devices.\n",
    "For example, when training neural networks on a server with a GPU,\n",
    "we typically prefer for the modelâ€™s parameters to live on the GPU.\n",

    "In short, for complex neural networks and large-scale data,\n",
    "using only CPUs for computation may be inefficient.\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss how\n",

    "First, make sure you have at least one NVIDIA GPU installed.\n",
    "Then, [download CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)\n",
    "and follow the prompts to set the appropriate path.\n",
    "Once these preparations are complete,\n",

    "### Side Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "People use GPUs to do machine learning \n",
    "because they expect them to be fast.\n",
    "But transferring variables between contexts is slow.\n",
    "So we want you to be 100% certain \n",
    "that you want to do something slow before we let you do it.\n",
    "If MXNet just did the copy automatically \n",
    "without crashing then you might not realize\n",
    "that you had written some slow code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, transferring data between devices (CPU, GPUs, other machines)\n",
    "is something that is *much slower* than computation.\n",
    "It also makes parallelization a lot more difficult,\n",
    "since we have to wait for data to be sent (or rather to be received)\n",
    "before we can proceed with more operations. \n",
    "This is why copy operations should be taken with great care.\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, many small operations \n",
    "are much worse than one big operation. \n",
    "Moreover, several operations at a time \n",
    "are much better than many single operations interspersed in the code \n",
    "(unless you know what you are doing)\n",
    "This is the case since such operations can block if one device \n",
    "has to wait for the other before it can do something else.\n",
    "It is a bit like ordering your coffee in a queue \n",
    "rather than pre-ordering it by phone\n",
    "and finding out that it is ready when you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, when we print `ndarray`s or convert `ndarray`s to the NumPy format, \n",
    "if the data is not in main memory, \n",
    "MXNet will copy it to the main memory first, \n",
    "resulting in additional transmission overhead.\n",
    "Even worse, it is now subject to the dreaded Global Interpreter Lock \n",
    "that makes everything wait for Python to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gluon and GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Gluon's model can specify devices \n",
    "through the `ctx` parameter during initialization.\n",
    "The following code initializes the model parameters on the GPU \n",
    "(we will see many more examples of \n",
    "how to run models on GPUs in the following, \n",
    "simply since they will become somewhat more compute intensive)."

    "In short, as long as all data and parameters are on the same device, we can learn models efficiently. In the following we will see several such examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* MXNet can specify devices for storage and calculation, such as CPU or GPU. \n",
    "  By default, MXNet creates data in the main memory \n",
    "  and then uses the CPU for calculations.\n",
    "* MXNet requires all input data for calculation \n",
    "  to be *on the same device*, \n",
    "  be it CPU or the same GPU.\n",
    "* You can lose significant performance by moving data without care. \n",
    "  A typical mistake is as follows: computing the loss \n",
    "  for every minibatch on the GPU and reporting it back \n",
    "  to the user on the command line (or logging it in a NumPy array)\n",
    "  will trigger a global interpreter lock which stalls all GPUs.\n",
    "  It is much better to allocate memory \n",
    "  for logging inside the GPU and only move larger logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try a larger computation task, such as the multiplication of large matrices, \n",
    "   and see the difference in speed between the CPU and GPU. \n",
    "   What about a task with a small amount of calculations?\n",
    "1. How should we read and write model parameters on the GPU?\n",
    "1. Measure the time it takes to compute 1000 \n",
    "   matrix-matrix multiplications of $100 \\times 100$ matrices \n",
    "   and log the matrix norm $\\mathrm{tr} M M^\\top$ one result at a time \n",
    "   vs. keeping a log on the GPU and transferring only the final result.\n",
    "1. Measure how much time it takes to perform two matrix-matrix multiplications \n",
    "   on two GPUs at the same time vs. in sequence \n",
    "   on one GPU (hint: you should see almost linear scaling).\n",
