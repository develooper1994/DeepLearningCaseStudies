    "but you would be a lousy web developer\n",

    "reinventing the wheel.\n",

    "which allow us to focus especially\n",
    "on the layers used to construct the model\n",

    "We will first define a model variable `net`,\n",

    "In Gluon, `Sequential` defines a container\n",

    "the first layer, in turn passing the output\n",
    "as the second layer's input and so forth.\n",
    "In the following example, our model consists of only one layer,\n",
    "so we do not really need `Sequential`.\n",
    "But since nearly all of our future models\n",
    "will involve multiple layers,\n",
    "we will use it anyway just to familiarize you\n",
