The testing set contains $300,000$ images, of which $10,000$ images are used for scoring, while the other $290,000$ non-scoring images are included to prevent the manual labeling of the testing set and the submission of labeling results. The image formats in both datasets are PNG, with heights and widths of 32 pixels and three color channels (RGB). The images cover $10$ categories: planes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, boats, and trucks. The upper-left corner of Figure 9.16 shows some images of planes, cars, and birds in the dataset.\n",
