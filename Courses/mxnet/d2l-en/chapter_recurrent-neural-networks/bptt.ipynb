For instance, for a sequence of 1000 characters, the first symbol could potentially have significant influence on the symbol at position 1000. This is not really computationally feasible (it takes too long and requires too much memory) and it requires over 1000 matrix-vector products before we would arrive at that very elusive gradient. This is a process fraught with computational and statistical uncertainty. In the following we will elucidate what happens and how to address this in practice.\n",

    "## A Simplified Recurrent Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a simplified model of how an RNN works. This model ignores details about the specifics of the hidden state and how it is updated. These details are immaterial to the analysis and would only serve to clutter the notation, but make it look more intimidating.\n",
    "In this simplified model, we denote $h_t$ as the hidden state, $x_t$ as the input, and $o_t$ as the output at timestep $t$. In addition, $w_h$ and $w_o$ indicate the weights of hidden states and the output layer, respectively. As a result, the hidden states and outputs at each timesteps can be explained as\n",

    "$$h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1}, w_h) \\text{ and } o_t = g(h_t, w_o).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we have a chain of values $\\{\\ldots, (h_{t-1}, x_{t-1}, o_{t-1}), (h_{t}, x_{t}, o_t), \\ldots\\}$ that depend on each other via recursive computation. The forward pass is fairly straightforward. All we need is to loop through the $(x_t, h_t, o_t)$ triples one step at a time. The discrepancy between outputs $o_t$ and the desired targets $y_t$ is then evaluated by an objective function as\n",

    "While we can use the chain rule to compute $\\partial_w h_t$ recursively, this chain can get very long whenever $t$ is large. Let us discuss a number of strategies for dealing with this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compute the full sum.** This is very slow and gradients can blow up, since subtle changes in the initial conditions can potentially affect the outcome a lot. That is, we could see things similar to the butterfly effect where minimal changes in the initial conditions lead to disproportionate changes in the outcome. This is actually quite undesirable in terms of the model that we want to estimate. After all, we are looking for robust estimators that generalize well. Hence this strategy is almost never used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Truncate the sum after** $\\tau$ **steps.** This is what we have been discussing so far. This leads to an *approximation* of the true gradient, simply by terminating the sum above at $\\partial_w h_{t-\\tau}$. The approximation error is thus given by $\\partial_h f(x_t, h_{t-1}, w) \\partial_w h_{t-1}$ (multiplied by a product of  gradients involving $\\partial_h f$). In practice this works quite well. It is what is commonly referred to as truncated BPTT (backpropgation through time). One of the consequences of this is that the model focuses primarily on short-term influence rather than long-term consequences. This is actually *desirable*, since it biases the estimate towards simpler and more stable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Randomized Truncation.** Last we can replace $\\partial_{w_h} h_t$ by a random variable which is correct in expectation but which truncates the sequence. This is achieved by using a sequence of $\\xi_t$ where $E[\\xi_t] = 1$ and $P(\\xi_t = 0) = 1-\\pi$ and furthermore $P(\\xi_t = \\pi^{-1}) = \\pi$. We use this to replace the gradient: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_t  = \\partial_w f(x_t, h_{t-1}, w) + \\xi_t \\partial_h f(x_t, h_{t-1}, w) \\partial_w h_{t-1}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "It follows from the definition of $\\xi_t$ that $E[z_t] = \\partial_w h_t$. Whenever $\\xi_t = 0$ the expansion terminates at that point. This leads to a weighted sum of sequences of varying lengths where long sequences are rare but appropriately overweighted. :cite:`Tallec.Ollivier.2017` proposed this in their paper. Unfortunately, while appealing in theory, the model does not work much better than simple truncation, most likely due to a number of factors. First, the effect of an observation after a number of backpropagation steps into the past is quite sufficient to capture dependencies in practice. Second, the increased variance counteracts the fact that the gradient is more accurate. Third, we actually *want* models that have only a short range of interaction. Hence, BPTT has a slight regularizing effect which can be desirable.\n",

In it, eigenvalues smaller than $1$ vanish for large $j$ and eigenvalues larger than $1$ diverge. This is numerically unstable and gives undue importance to potentially irrelevant past detail. One way to address this is to truncate the sum at a computationally convenient size. Later on in :numref:`chap_modern_rnn` we will see how more sophisticated sequence models such as LSTMs can alleviate this further. In practice, this truncation is effected by *detaching* the gradient after a given number of steps.\n",
