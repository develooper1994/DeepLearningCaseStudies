# support vector machine is similar to Linear regression.
# it is using for classification and regression(time series prediction), outlier detection, clustering
# Speed is generally is higher than neural networks but prediction accuracy is lower.
# If you have small amount of data svm good to go.

# if data has N dimension hyperplane is N-1 dimension
